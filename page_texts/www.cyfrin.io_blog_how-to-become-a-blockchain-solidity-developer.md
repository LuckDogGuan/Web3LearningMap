With that said, let's get started on our roadmap!

‍

‍Blockchain developer roadmap

‍

1. Learn programming fundamentals

‍If you're starting without any previous development experience, the first step to becoming a blockchain developer is learning how to code.JavaScript is a highly recommended programming language for those who are starting out. It’s not only beginner-friendly but also versatile, making it particularly suitable for your first steps as a developer.

‍Key resources:

CS50: Introduction to Computer Science covers all the essential topics in computer science and introduces programming languages like Python and JavaScript.
Net Ninja offers over 2,000 free programming tutorial videos designed to "black-belt" your web development skills. Covering a wide range of topics such as modern JavaScript (beginner to advanced), Node.js, React, Vue.js, Firebase, MongoDB, and more, it’s an ideal free resource for developers at any level.
‍
‍2. Learn the fundamentals of blockchain and smart contract development

Once you have a broad understanding of how programming works, the next step in our blockchain developer roadmap is to learn how web3, blockchains, and decentralized systems work.We’ve watched all the resources available online, literally, and there are two completely free courses (linked in the key resources below) that cover the entire journey from no programming experience to competent blockchain developer.On top of the fundamentals of blockchain, you will learn how to develop, deploy, and test Solidity smart contracts using Hardhat and Foundry. You’ll also learn advanced Solidity development tips, as well as best practices to enhance the security of your codebases.

‍Key resources:

The course mentioned before, Full Solidity, Blockchain, and Smart Contracts development course, covers everything from zero to hero -  from complete blockchain fundamentals to advanced smart contract development, building projects, and practicing your skills.
Alchemy’s Ethereum Developer Bootcamp and mastering Solidity by example with hands-on projects are other great courses with hands-on exercises that teach the fundamentals of Blockchains, Ethereum, and Solidity, from 0 to 100.
‍
Solidity development exercises

‍On top of those two courses, we suggest you go and exercise your skills, build real-world projects, or go through the challenges on platforms like the ones listed below.

‍Key Resources:

Speed Run Ethereum is a series of challenges where you will have to develop seven different web3 projects.
CryptoZombies is one of the first Solidity learning platforms to appear in the eco-system. It is a gamified step-by-step guide where you’ll need to create an army of zombies through numerous Solidity challenges.
‍
Set your blockchain development skills apart - learn Vyper

‍Once you understand how blockchain, Ethereum, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and smart contract development using Solidity work, it’s time to deepen your knowledge and start learning Vyper!

‍Vyper is a Pythonic alternative to Solidity rapidly gaining popularity among the community. It is an EVM programming language focusing on the language's security, compiler simplicity, and auditability. It’s also considered to be more human-readable.

‍Key resources:

Cyfrin Updraft’s Vyper courses: Introduction, Intermediate, Advanced
Vyper by Example and the official Vyper docs
Vyper.fun is another project maintained by the Vyper community where you’ll learn Vyper by building games
‍
‍3. Learn Yul and Huff
‍


Once you have learned how to develop, deploy, and test smart contracts using Solidity or Vyper, you can move into lower-level concepts. You can start optimizing your Solidity smart contracts gas consumption or simply gain a deeper understanding of the workings of the EVM for fun. 

And then, you should definitely learn Yul and Huff:

Yul: is an intermediate language, similar to assembly (which you can learn on Updraft), that can be compiled into bytecode for different backends. It's designed for developers who want more control over their smart contracts' execution.
Huff: on the other hand, is a standalone, low-level programming language designed for developing highly optimized smart contracts that run on the EVM. While experts can use Huff to write highly efficient smart contracts for use in production, it can also serve as a way for beginners to learn more about EVM.
‍
4. Learn how to write secure smart contracts

‍Since 2015, nearly $14,000,000,000 has been stolen from decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contracts, and users’ wallets due to low-security awareness, creative hackers, and lack of education about smart contract audits. But now, developers are starting to prioritize and adopt best practices and rigorous smart contract auditing practices.

‍

‍The need for security has made it crucial for developers to spend more time learning how to write secure codebases and use best practices to protect the value of protocols and users.

In addition to this how to become a blockchain developer roadmap - we’ve put together a collection of the best resources and platforms to teach you about smart contract auditing and help you monetize your skills as a blockchain security expert through competitive and solo audits.

You should also check out the smart contract auditing course on Cyfrin Updraft - the industry-leading, go-to course for smart contract security researchers.

‍

‍5. Learn web3 frontend development

‍

‍

Once you’ve learned how to develop, test, and secure smart contracts, it’s time to learn how to create outstanding user interfaces (UIs) to interact with them!Some of the resources above will teach you most of what you need to start creating decentralized apps (dApps) front-ends. However, if you want to dig deeper into the field, you can’t miss checking the tools and resources listed below.

‍Key resources:

Ethers.js is probably the most common library amongst web3 frontend developers. It aims to be a complete and compact tool for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and its ecosystem.
Wagmi is a collection of React Hooks that makes it easy to connect wallets, display Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and balance information, sign messages,  and interact with contracts from front-end applications.
Viem, is built by the same creators of WAGMI and delivers modular and composable APIs. It also offers typescript primitives for developers and intuitive building blocks to build Ethereum apps and libraries.
The Alchemy SDK is a comprehensive and stable Javascript software development kit (SDK) with a 1:1 mapping for anyone using the Ethers.js Providers. It adds significantly improved functionality on top of Ethers, such as easy access to Alchemy’s Enhanced and NFT APIs, robust WebSockets, and quality-of-life improvements such as automated retries.
‍
‍Conclusion

‍This roadmap on how to become a blockchain developer gave you all the resources you'll need to kickstart your smart contract development or security career. You can go from zero to the top 1% of web3 developers completely for free.

So, if you’ve made it here! Congratulations 🎉 You only miss one thing now. Practice!
