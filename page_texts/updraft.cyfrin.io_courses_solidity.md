Course description

The best way to learn Solidity online is with Cyfrin Updraft’s Solidity Smart Contract Development course. This is more than a simple Solidity tutorial. It is a comprehensive Solidity programming course. It will teach you how to become a smart contract developer and level up your web3 development career .

Take one hour per day for five days and learn Solidity programming. Build real web3 projects, get hands-on experience writing smart contracts, and learn the Solidity programming language from scratch.

Solidity Smart Contract Development is the most comprehensive, straightforward introduction to the Solidity programming language ever created. Over 200,000 students have already learned how to develop smart contracts following Updraft’s complete Solidity course.

Whether you have never written a line of code, know the basic syntax of smart contracts, or want to dive deeper into web3 development, this Solidity smart contract development course is for you!

You’ll get familiar with Solidity concepts and use Remix IDE to set up your web3 development environment. Regardless of your operating system: Linux, macOS, or Windows, we've got you covered.

Then, you’ll learn about basic variable types, functions, arrays, structs, mapping, calldata, memory, and deploy your first Solidity smart contract. You’ll continue with Solidity imports, learn how to interact with contract ABIs, and understand inheritance.

Learn Solidity reverts, blockchain oracles, and how to send ETH through a function. Practice importing libraries from NPM and GitHub. Create your Solidity libraries and discover how to implement a fallback function.

Even if you have no experience programming Solidity, this Solidity Smart Contract Development course will transform you into a working web3 developer in just five hours of instruction.

This Solidity programming course contains 40 video tutorials with corresponding written lessons. It also includes exercises and projects to strengthen your learning. You’ll develop the foundational Solidity programming skills necessary to move into advanced smart contract development and security concepts.

Solidity Smart Contract Development is a project-based, fully hands-on Solidity programming course, designed to help you become a working blockchain developer. It includes quizzes, tests, exercises, assignments, and projects to help you build a portfolio of functional Solidity smart contracts!

Learn to build real-world Solidity contracts. Work with testnets, test your codebase, and create a front end to connect your wallet and interact with your smart contracts.

Begin your journey as a working smart contract developer.

Solidity Smart Contract Development is your first step from beginner to professional, even with zero programming experience. Here's why:

Learn Solidity from industry-leading Solidity developers and web3 educators.
Updraft courses are always updated to reflect current industry standards. Learn the latest Solidity tools and technologies with content that is continually refreshed with new projects, modules, and quizzes.
You will develop real-world Solidity programming skills used by top companies and blockchain protocols.
The curriculum is rigorously tested and continuously refined through student feedback.
Over 200,000 students have chosen Updraft to learn Solidity, blockchain, decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized applications (dApps), and distributed ledger technology.
Thousands of students have changed their lives. They’ve become blockchain engineers, smart contract and dApp auditors, or professional blockchain developers. Many have launched careers at industry-leading blockchain companies.
You'll save over $10,000. This Solidity programming course is completely free, giving you access to the industry-leading Solidity tutorial.

You will learn:

To set up and deploy your first Solidity contract
Solidity variable types, functions, arrays, and structs
Memory, calldata, mappings
Inheritance, how to interact with contract ABIs
How to use AI to support development
How to send ETH through a function and a contract
Blockchain oracles
How to import libraries from NPM and GitHub
Solidity math
Constructors, function modifiers, immutability, and constants

This is the best course to learn the Solidity programming language. Every lecture has a full coding screencast and written lessons to learn from. Choose the method that fits you best!

By the end of this course, you will be ready to be a Solidity smart contract developer!

As a Cyfrin Updraft student, you get lifetime access to every course, corresponding tutorials, resources, code, quizzes, and repositories for free!

So what are you waiting for?
