Solidity Tutorial
The Ultimate Solidity Course
A high quality, in depth Solidity course for experienced developers, free, comprehensive, and trusted by smart contract security experts.
Skip to Contents
Who is this course for?

This course is for experienced programmers. If you don’t already know how to code, we suggest picking up Python or JavaScript first then coming back.

If you are new to Solidity, start at the beginning.

However, Solidity developers of all levels can benefit from the resources here in the later sections discuss very advanced topics such as how Tornado Cash works. We also have the only protocol walkthrough of the Compound V3 codebase.

The only paid bootcamp with a free curriculum

Other bootcamps charge hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars just to see their curriculum. At RareSkills, we believe the entire community benefits when high quality education is freely available. And by free we mean truly free not gated with an email we can monetize later.

The work is truly a public good.

We do hope you will sign up for our bootcamp though! You’ll get time with instructors and a community who have secured billions of dollars in TVL (total value locked).

RareSkills quality

Although this is not a smart contract security course per se, smart contract security researchers regularly refer to the resources here. Our philosophy is that security comes from deeply understanding what you are doing.

Therefore, we don’t create a large list of topics just for the sake of it. We deeply examine non-obvious issues that even experienced Solidity engineers sometimes miss; having taught many through our Solidity Bootcamp we know where the knowledge gaps frequently lie.

Deep understanding should be the expectation for anyone writing code than manages other people’s crypto. As such, our tutorials prioritize generating strong mental models even if it takes more effort to do so.

Finally, we encourage you to compare our tutorials with others on the same subject (and those generated by an AI chatbot).

We are sure you will be impressed at the level of depth, comprehensiveness, and clarity our articles achieve.

Beginner Solidity Tutorial

No email required! This is for experienced programmers who want to get to the point quickly and immediately practice the information they just gained in a highly optimized topic order. We emphasize the unexpected and unusual aspects of the Solidity language while glossing over things we can reasonably assume to be obvious to a competent developer. Aside from an occasional humorous remark, we’ve made the tutorials as short as possible (but not shorter). Although this is a solidity beginner tutorial, it is intended for experienced coders.

There is a distinction between knowing a language, and knowing a domain. Knowing Python doesn’t make you a data scientist, knowing Javascript doesn’t make you a frontend developer, and knowing Kotlin does not make you an Android developer. Similarly, knowing Solidity does not make you an Ethereum smart contract developer. However, Solidity is a prerequisite for developing smart contracts.

Detecting if an address is a smart contract
This article describes three methods in Solidity for determining if an address is a smart contract:
View Tutorial
Solidity Function Selector
The function selector is a 4 byte id that Solidity uses to identify functions under the hood.
View Tutorial
ERC-721 design and security issues
ERC721 (or ERC-721) is the most widely used Ethereum standard for nonfungible tokens.

DeFi Primitives
Design Patterns Used Everywhere

Some building blocks and design patterns occur so frequently in DeFi applications that they are best studied directly. Don’t just read these tutorials, practice the problems at the end.

The staking algorithm of MasterChef and Synthetix
The MasterChef and Synthetix staking algorithms distribute a fixed reward pool among stakers according to their time-weighted contributions to a pool.

Uniswap V2 Walkthrough
The most forked DeFi protocol

Uniswap V2 is the most forked protocol in DeFi and has inspired several more. The Uniswap V2 Book is a line-by-line examination of the protocol.

Architecture
Uniswap is a DeFi app that enables traders to swap one token for another in a trustless manner.
View Tutorial
Price Impact of a Swap
This article explains how to determine the price settlement of a trading pair in an Automated Market Maker (AMM).
View Tutorial
Swap Function
Uniswap V2’s swap function is cleverly designed, but many devs find its logic counterintuitive the first time they encounter it.
View Tutorial
Mint and Burn Functions
The lifecycle of Uniswap V2 is someone mints LP tokens (supplies liquidity, i.e. tokens to the pool) for the first time.
View Tutorial
Protocol mintFee
Uniswap V2 was designed to collect 1/6th of the swap fees to the protocol. Since a swap fee is 0.3%, 1/6th of that is 0.05%, so 0.05% of every trade would go to the protocol.
View Tutorial
TWAP Oracle
Suppose we have 1 Ether and 2,000 USDC in a pool. This implies that the price of Ether is 2,000 USDC.
View Tutorial
UniswapV2Library
The Uniswap V2 Library simplifies some interactions with pair contracts and is used heavily by the Router contracts.
View Tutorial
Routers
The Router contracts provide a user-facing smart contract for safely minting and burning LP tokens (adding and removing liquidity)

EVM Storage
How storage variables work under the hood
View Tutorial
Low-level call in Solidity
A contract in Solidity can call other contracts via two methods: through the contract interface, which is considered a high-level call, or by using the call method, which is a low-level approach.
View Tutorial
Delegatecall
This article explains how delegatecall works in detail. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) offers four opcodes for making calls between contracts:
View Tutorial
ERC-1967
EIP 1967 is a standard for where to store information that proxy contracts need to execute.
View Tutorial
ERC-7201
ERC-7201 (formerly EIP-7201) is a standard for grouping storage variables together by a common identifier called a namespace.
View Tutorial
Transparent Upgradeable Proxy
The Transparent Upgradeable Proxy is a design pattern for upgrading a proxy while eliminating the possibility of a function selector clash.
View Tutorial
Beacon Proxies
EIP 1967 is a standard for where to store information that proxy contracts need to execute.
View Tutorial
Clones
EIP-1167, which is also referred to as the minimal proxy contract, is a commonly used solidity pattern for cheaply creating proxy clones.
View Tutorial
Metaproxy Clones
The minimal proxy standard allows us to parameterize the creation of the clone, but this requires an extra initialization transaction.
View Tutorial
Nodelegatecall
The nodelegatecall modifier prevents delegatecalls from being sent to a contract.
View Tutorial
Solidity Governance
How DAOs coordinate onchain
ERC-20 Snapshots
ERC20 Snapshot solves the problem of double voting.
View Tutorial
ERC-20 Votes
ERC20 Votes does not actually handle conducting the poll, it’s still a regular ERC20 token with snapshot and delegated voting abilities.
View Tutorial
Solidity Governance
The pattern of governance many DeFi applications follows is heavily inspired by Compound Finance’s implementation.

Compound V3 Walkthrough
Explore the codebase of the most influential lending protocol

Compound V2 is the most forked lending protocol, but it is no longer used, so our walkthrough focuses on Compound V3. Nearly every modern lending protocol takes inspiration from Compound, so if you completely understand the codebase, you will easily be able to understand other DeFi lending protocols.

Architechture of Compound V3
Compound is one of the most significant lending protocols in DeFi, having inspired the design of nearly every lending protocol on several blockchains.
